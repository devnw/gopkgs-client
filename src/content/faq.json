    "answer": "Custom domain imports were added to the <code>go get</code> command to allow for import paths that were not directly hosted by a version control system. Instead these import paths are hosted on a custom domain with a page that contains a <code>meta</code> tag that redirects to the underlying repository. This allows for a more friendly experience for users of the custom domain.",
