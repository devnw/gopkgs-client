# About Vanity Import Paths in Google Go

Go Packages (`gopkgs.org`) is created to be a FREE service to allow Go developers
to setup their own vanity import paths without having to go through the hassle
of setting up a custom site with meta tags, hosting, content, etc.

## Cost

### Is this service free?

Yes, it is free.

### Even for custom domains?

Yup, you can use your own domain name for free.

### Why would you do that?

For reasons other than being a benevolent OSS Contributor? I don't know.

## How does it work?

### Vanity Import Paths

Vanity Import paths were added to the `go get` command to allow for pointing to
the version control repository of a package rather than using an import path
that **was** the version control repository.
